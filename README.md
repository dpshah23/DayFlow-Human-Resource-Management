## Getting Started (Step by Step)

We'll start with Phase 1: Setting up the backend with Prisma.

### What is Prisma?
Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that helps you interact with databases using JavaScript/TypeScript in a more intuitive way. Think of it as a translator between your JavaScript code and the database.
